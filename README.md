This is a project I made for my Information Systems 403 class. It is basically a journal that asks the user how they exemplified a principle from How to Win Friends and Influence People. 

In order to run this program, you will need to git clone this repo into your VS Code, change the .env file, and set up your postgres Database to work with the code that I have written.
